# Welcome to My Mastermind
This project is an implementation of the classic game "Mastermind" in C.

## Task
The task is to create a program called my_mastermind that allows players to attempt to crack a secret code within 10 attempts. The program receives the player's input and provides feedback on the number of well-placed and misplaced pieces after each attempt.

## Description
The game comprises 9 pieces of different colors, and the secret code consists of 4 distinct pieces. Players have 10 attempts to guess the secret code. The program reads the player's input from the standard input and provides feedback on well-placed and misplaced pieces.

The program also accepts parameters:
- -c [CODE]: Specifies the secret code. If no code is provided, a random code will be generated.
- -t [ATTEMPTS]: Specifies the number of attempts. By default, the player has 10 attempts.

## Installation
To compile the program, use the provided Makefile and ensure the code is compiled with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.

## Usage
Execute the program my_mastermind with the appropriate parameters and follow the prompts to input guesses for the secret code. The program will provide feedback on the correctness of the guesses.
