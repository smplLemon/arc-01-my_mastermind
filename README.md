# Description

Mastermind is a game composed of 9 pieces of different colors. A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces.

The player has 10 attempts to find the secret code. After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.

Pieces will be '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8'.

If the player finds the code, he wins, and the game stops. A misplaced piece is a piece that is present in the secret code butthat is not in a good position.

You must read the player's input from the standard input.

Your program will also receive the following parameters: -c [CODE]: specifies the secret code. If no code is specified, a random code will be generated. -t [ATTEMPTS]: specifies the number of attempts; by default, the playerhas 10 attempts.

# Task

you must create a Makefile, and the ouput is the command itself It will contain rule all/clean/fclean (re => fclean + all)

You can use:

printf(3)
write(2)
read(2)
rand() (/ srand())
time()
atoi()
strcmp()
You can NOT use:
Any functions/syscalls which does not appear in the previous list
Yes, it includes exit
Consider writing a README.md to describe your project and how it works.

Your mastermind needs to handle the sequence Ctrl + d. It's End Of File. It's consider as a normal execution.

read() is a syscall difficult to apprehend, you will have time to deal more with it in a later project. In this project, you should read 1 character by 1 (use read(0, &c, 1)) and add them one by one to a buffer until you encounter a newline.
