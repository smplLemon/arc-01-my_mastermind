# Mastermind Game

## Overview

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player, known as the "codebreaker," tries to guess the secret code generated by the other player, known as the "codemaker." The codemaker sets a secret code consisting of a sequence of colored pegs, and the codebreaker attempts to deduce the code by making guesses and receiving feedback after each guess.

This project implements the Mastermind game in C, allowing players to play the game in a terminal environment.

## Features

- **Secret Code Generation:** The codemaker can either manually set a secret code or have one randomly generated.
- **Guess Feedback:** After each guess, the game provides feedback to the codebreaker, indicating the number of correctly placed pegs (well-placed pieces) and the number of pegs with the correct color but in the wrong position (misplaced pieces).
- **Multiple Rounds:** Players can play multiple rounds of the game within the same session.
- **Command-Line Interface:** The game is played entirely in the terminal using a command-line interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation

```bash
gcc mastermind.c -o mastermind
```
- **Or** 
```bash
make 
```

### Usage

```bash
./mastermind [-c secret_code]
```

- `-c`: Optional flag to specify the secret code. If not provided, a random code will be generated.

## Gameplay

1. The game starts with the codemaker setting a secret code.
2. The codebreaker makes guesses by entering sequences of colored pegs.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating the number of well-placed pieces and misplaced pieces.
4. The codebreaker continues making guesses until the correct code is guessed or the maximum number of attempts is reached.
5. The game ends, and the codebreaker receives a victory or defeat message.

## Example

```bash
./mastermind -c "RBYG"
```

This command starts a game of Mastermind with a secret code set to "RBYG".
