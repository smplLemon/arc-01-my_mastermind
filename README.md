# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The task of this project is to create a Mastermind game that runs in the terminal. The challenge is to implement the game logic and interface using only the allowed functions.

## Description
The game is a two-player game where one player creates a secret code consisting of four colors, and the other player tries to guess the code within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the code-maker gives feedback by indicating how many colors are correct and in the right position (marked with a black pin), and how many colors are correct but in the wrong position (marked with a white pin).
To play the game, run the executable mastermind in the terminal. The game will prompt the code-maker to enter a four-color code using the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. The code-breaker then has ten attempts to guess the code by entering their own four-color code. After each guess, the game will display the number of black and white pins, indicating how many colors are correct and in the right position, and how many colors are correct but in the wrong position.

## Installation
To install the game, clone the repository and run make in the terminal. This will create the executable mastermind.

## Usage
To play the game, run the executable mastermind in the terminal. The game will guide you through the steps.
