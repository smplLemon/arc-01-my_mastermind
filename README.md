## Welcome to my_mastermind

Welcome to my_mastermind, a simple implementation of the Mastermind game in C.

## Task

Your task is to guess the secret code generated by the program within a certain number of rounds. After each guess, you'll receive feedback indicating how many digits are correctly placed and how many are misplaced.

## Description

This program allows you to play the classic Mastermind game in the command line interface. You can specify the number of rounds and even provide your own secret code if you want.

## Installation

To install my_mastermind, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_mastermind.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my_mastermind`
3. Compile the program: `gcc -o my_mastermind mastermind.c`
4. Run the program: `./my_mastermind`

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the compiled executable. You can optionally specify the number of rounds and provide your own secret code using command-line arguments.

Here's an example:

```bash
./my_mastermind -t 10 -c 1234
```

This command starts the game with 10 rounds and sets the secret code to "1234". If you don't specify any arguments, the game will use default values.

During the game, follow the prompts to enter your guesses. After each guess, you'll receive feedback indicating how close you are to guessing the secret code.

Enjoy playing Mastermind!
